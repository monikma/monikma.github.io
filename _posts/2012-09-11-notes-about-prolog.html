<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It is important to define from the beginning the meaning of terms&nbsp;for oneself&nbsp;(e.g. what "gold" means - a color or substance), so that there is no ambiguity later. The same applies to the order of argument of course.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Facts</h3><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">relation_name(argument_1,argument_2,...,argument_n).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">relation_name = predicate</span><br /><br />Collection of facts is called database. Database contains also rules.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Questions</h3><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">?- predicate(arg_1, arg_2, ..).</span><br /><br />or<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">?- predicate(arg_1, Var_1, ..).</span><br /><br />No answer means that the question is "not provable", it does not mean that the answer is "no".<br /><br />Prolog searches the database from the beginning to the end; if it finds a match it marks this place in database it instantiates the variable with the matched constan and returns this first match; if the user enters ';', the variable values are cleared and another search is being done from the place previously marked.<br /><br />If there are several variables, they are instantiated one by one, for each the database is being searched from the beginning.<br /><br />For conjunction of questions we use comma between goals. If there's conjunction of goals, Prolog attempts to satisfy each goal in turn, from left to right.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Rules</h3><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">predicate1(arg_1, Var_1,..) :- predicate2(agr_2, Var_1, ..)</span><br /><br />This means that predicate1 implies from predicate2.<br /><br />The underscore _ marks an anonymous variable.<br /><br /></div>
