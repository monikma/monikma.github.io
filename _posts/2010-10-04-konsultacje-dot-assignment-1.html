<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">MVC - Model View Controller<br /><ul><li>!! The model is responsible for all the <span style="font-weight: bold;">logic</span>.</li><li>Controller is responsible for user input, e.g. checking for <span style="font-weight: bold;">syntax error</span>;<br />Model  is responsible for the logic, also checking <span style="font-weight: bold;">logic errors</span> in the input;<br />!! But it is controller who makes sure the user is displayed error message;</li><li>The model has to communicate with view: it can be  done either by:<br />- sending data encapsulated in an object - but then please do not include any logic in the object, it is just for data sending (as the view will have the access to all object's methods);<br />- by defining some other <span style="font-weight: bold;">protocol </span>defined, like sending just pure data (better);</li><li>The Model does not send the data to View - it puts the data 'somewhere', and <span style="font-weight: bold;">notifies </span>all views whenever its data has been changed; the views know where to get the data from; this is because we may have many views and just one model, it is not a good idea to send the data to all views each time;</li></ul>In the undergraduate course they're learning the design patterns, and how to write down an application's architecture, how to do <span style="font-weight: bold;">reverse engineering</span>, how to implement a pattern or recognize what is the architecture type; but in the graduate course you will also learn <span style="font-weight: bold;">how do you know whether an architecture is good or bad</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">which one is better</span>;<br /><br />In Taks 4, when asked if now you would come up with different architecture for the your certain old application and why, you should think of if you're able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">improve the quality</span> by changing the architecture; by improving quality I mean improving one of the 6 quality components, which were <span style="font-weight: bold;">modifiability</span>, security, etc.<br /><br />This is how you could initialize an MVC application:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;PhoneBookModel model = new PhoneBookModel();</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;PhoneBookView view = new PhoneBookView(model);&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">public PhoneBookView(PhoneBookModel model) {</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;this.model = model;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;model.attach(this);</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;this.controller = new PhoneBookController(model, this);&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp;controller.startApp();</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}</span></div>
