<div class="bg-info panel-body" markdown="1">
Those are the notes I took during the Cloud Guru [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/certified-solutions-architect-associate/overview).
Note that the course content changes as the AWS changes. The notes are from March-May 2024.

This section is about everything AWS that has to do with governance: AWS Organisations, Cost Explorer, audits, and so on.
