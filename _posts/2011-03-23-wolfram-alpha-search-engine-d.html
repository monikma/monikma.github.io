<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Wolfram Alpha Search Engine:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">http://www.wolframalpha.com/</a><br /><br />Wow! it's like seeing information EXACTLY IN THE WAY I AM USED TO STORING IT IN MY BRAIN. I didn't even realise how I remember and organise the information in my brain it up to now. It is as if I was looking at a snapshot, a photo of my memory. Awesome :) and this makes it so usable, so easy to navigate...<br /><br />The only problem is that it does not understand more complicated questions, e.g. "what is a white hole" gave information about white colour... i guess it is still a long way to go before it can actually be useful..<br /><br />..but anyway I just really understood the power of Semantic Web :)</div>
