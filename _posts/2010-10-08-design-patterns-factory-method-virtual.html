The <span style="font-style: italic;">factoryMethod()</span> method is then for example used in the abstract Creator whenever the Product of unknown type was needed.<br /><br />We can also use this methd when we want to specify the object type to create in Creator subclasses.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consequences:</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">(+) </span>the code in abstract Creator is not application-specific, not bound to any specific product implementation</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">(-) </span>each time we want to create specific Product, we have to subclass Creator class - so this method is good if we would do it anyway, otherwise it is just making the application more complicated</li><li>we can also use it pattern when Creator has delegated part of its responsibilities to another class (Manipulator); then in Manipulator we can also use the <span style="font-style: italic;">factoryMethod()</span> methods (in the book the Manipulator class was abstract, and its various subclasses were using  <span style="font-style: italic;">factoryMethod()</span> methods of corresponding subclasses of Creator class; that is why this case was called the case of parralel class hierarchy</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variations</span><br /><ul><li>Creator does not have to be abstract; it can be concrete and provide default Product implementation</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">factoryMethod()</span> can take a parameter telling which object to instantiate; in such case the Creator would create some objects, the rest can be created by Creator's subclasses (but in such case these subclasses must call the Creator's <span style="font-style: italic;">factoryMethod() </span>method at the end)</li><li>and many other variations..</li></ul></div>
